//! Shared atomic provisioning of a channel binding's dedicated bridge
//! thread.
//!
//! Any HTTP handler that can flip a [`ChannelBinding`]'s `enabled` bit — the
//! agent-profile `PUT` route and each channel's own secret-setting route
//! (e.g. Telegram's token endpoint) — must provision the binding's
//! `bridge_thread_id` in the same request that enables it. Before this
//! helper existed, only the profile `PUT` route did that provisioning, so a
//! bot enabled purely through the Telegram token endpoint silently never
//! started until some later, unrelated profile save happened to trigger
//! provisioning.
