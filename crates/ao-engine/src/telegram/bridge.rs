//! Channel-agnostic inbound supervisor.
//!
//! [`ChannelBridge`] is a supervisor, spawned once at process start
//! alongside [`crate::schedule_runner::ScheduleRunner`]. It periodically
//! reconciles which agents have an enabled, fully-provisioned channel
//! binding (Telegram, Discord, and later email, ...) and keeps exactly one
//! inbound task alive per binding, selecting the
//! [`crate::channels::ChannelTransport`] implementation registered for that
//! binding's [`ChannelKind`]. Each inbound message is written to the
//! binding's dedicated bridge thread and submitted through the normal
//! message queue, so the agent processes it exactly like a typed chat turn
//! — no separate run path. This file only covers pushing messages in; the
//! outbound half (relaying a finished turn back out) is currently
//! Telegram- and Discord-only — see [`super::outbound`] and
//! [`crate::channels::discord::outbound`] — since those are the only two
//! synchronous chat channels; a future email channel delivers replies via a
//! tool call instead.
