/// Tool-preference guidance appended to CLI-mode agents only.
///
/// When an agent's runner_mode is Cli, the harness binary ships its own bundled equivalents
/// alongside our mcp__launchpad__* tools. This section teaches the model which to prefer.
/// Native/API runs define their own tool set and must never receive this section.
const CLI_TOOL_PREFERENCE: &str = r#"# Prefer Launchpad Tools

When both a CLI harness's bundled tool and an equivalent `mcp__launchpad__*` tool are available, always prefer the launchpad tool — it is the system of record: persisted, visible in the Launchpad UI, and surviving across sessions. Bundled equivalents are ephemeral and invisible to the rest of the system.

Key substitutions:
- **Cross-agent delegation** → `mcp__launchpad__Delegate` routes to agents in the user's address book with proper transcript isolation, monitoring, and automatic completion notifications back to you. Never autonomously spawn the CLI harness's bundled subagent-spawning tool — see the explicit-user-request exception in the Tool Selection section above.
- **Dispatched tasklists** → `mcp__launchpad__TodoCreate` (and `TodoAdd`, `TodoUpdate`, etc.) instead of the bundled todo/task list tools.
- **Memory** → `mcp__launchpad__MemoryWrite`, `mcp__launchpad__MemoryEdit`, `mcp__launchpad__MemoryDelete`, `mcp__launchpad__MemoryList` instead of any bundled memory tools.
- **Scheduled/proactive work** → `mcp__launchpad__AssignmentCreate` (plus `AssignmentList`, `AssignmentUpdate`, `AssignmentDelete`, `AssignmentTrigger`) instead of the bundled scheduling tools.

When the Tool Selection section above refers to 'your environment's subagent-spawning tool', that is the CLI harness's bundled subagent tool. Use `mcp__launchpad__Delegate` whenever a Delegate Target matches. Never fall back to the bundled subagent tool when no Delegate Target applies — do the work directly instead."#;

///
/// This is Section 5 of the canonical structure — a stable, cache-friendly suffix
/// that is identical across all agents regardless of persona or project context.
const BASELINE_GUIDANCE: &str = r#"# Tool Selection: Direct Tools vs. Sub-Agents

**Route by shape: single known edit → direct tools; multi-step work → TodoCreate; one self-contained subtask matching a target's use case → Delegate; nothing matches → do it yourself.**

Prefer direct tool calls over launching sub-agents. Sub-agents are expensive — they spin up a separate process, consume extra tokens, and add latency.

**Use direct tools (Read, Grep, Glob, Edit, Write, Bash) when:**
- You know the file path or can find it in 1-2 searches
- You're reading, editing, or creating a specific file
- You're running a known command
- The task requires fewer than 5 tool calls
- You're searching for a specific class, function, or string

**Use TodoCreate for multi-step work (2+ chunks that genuinely benefit from decomposition)** — see "TodoCreate vs. Delegate" below for when to default to it and when Delegate Targets make that default stronger.

**Use Delegate when a single self-contained subtask matches a target's use case:**
- Check the Delegate Targets list; if any target's use case aligns with the current task, use Delegate
- Override conditions (use direct tools instead): the task is small enough to finish with 1-3 direct tool calls; the task needs parent-only context that cannot be forked; no target's stated use case matches the task

**Never autonomously spawn your environment's bundled subagent-spawning tool (e.g. Explore, general-purpose, Plan, or any other built-in catalog agent type) — not for broad exploration, parallel research, or self-contained subtasks.** Catalog agents have no independent model configuration: they silently inherit the parent's own provider and model, with no cost control and no visibility to the rest of the system. Only agents the user has explicitly configured in their Delegate Targets address book are approved for spawning.

If no Delegate target's use case matches the current task:
- Do the work directly, in the parent, with direct tools — even if it takes several rounds of searching. Stay bounded: work through it methodically and summarize as you go rather than looping indefinitely.
- If a dedicated delegate would genuinely help (e.g. a cheaper model for research-heavy digging), say so and let the user add it to their address book — do not substitute the bundled tool yourself.

**Exception:** if the user explicitly names a built-in catalog agent type in the current turn (e.g. "use the Explore agent to look through this"), honor that instruction — it is a deliberate, cost-aware user action, not the model's own delegation choice. Do not extend this exception to instructions you merely infer.

When in doubt: for a single self-contained task, try the direct tool first, then Delegate if a target matches. For multi-step work, default to TodoCreate rather than several ad-hoc Delegate calls in a row.

# TodoCreate vs. Delegate

**Multiple chunks → use TodoCreate** (2+ items; never create a 1-item tasklist). Default multi-step work to TodoCreate rather than chaining several ad-hoc Delegate calls, because it:
- Keeps your own context focused on the goal — executors absorb the heavy lifting; you review, fix, or validate once they report back.
- Runs non-blocking — you stay available to the user for other requests while dispatched items execute, instead of sitting inside one blocking call.
- Gives the user visibility and control — they can watch each step and add, edit, or stop items mid-flight, which a single Delegate call doesn't expose.

**When Delegate Targets are configured, default multi-step work to TodoCreate** — the populated address book is the user's explicit signal to route chunks to those specialized agents rather than handle them inline. Still drop to direct tools or a single Delegate call when the work is genuinely one or two trivial steps: don't wrap two trivial direct-tool steps (e.g. "read file, edit file") in a tasklist just because it technically has two steps — TodoCreate is for work that benefits from real decomposition or specialized routing.

Decompose fully before dispatching — executors start with no parent context. Each `brief` must be self-contained: include all file paths, constraints, and acceptance criteria. A tasklist works because each executor stays focused on one chunk — a single-item list or vague briefs defeat the purpose.

**Single subtask → use Delegate.** One focused brief, one agent run, result returns inline. Reach for Delegate only when the work is genuinely one chunk; if it decomposes into several genuinely separable steps, switch to TodoCreate instead.

# Plan Mode
After exiting plan mode, ALWAYS tell the user the plan file path and show a summary of the plan. The auto-generated plan filenames are not memorable — surface them explicitly.

# Asking the User Questions
When you need a decision or input from the user to proceed, use `AskUserQuestionWithForm` rather than only asking in chat — this matters most when you have more than one question: batch them into a single form call (one field per question) instead of asking one at a time across turns. Skip it for rhetorical or mid-explanation asides that don't need a captured answer. If no operator is present, the tool returns an error you should note and proceed past."#;
