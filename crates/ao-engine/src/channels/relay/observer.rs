//! Shared `EventBus` observer step for a synchronous chat channel's
//! outbound relay: buffer each thread's most recent `TextComplete` since its
//! run started, and on `RunEnded` resolve that thread's reply target through
//! a [`CorrelationMap`] and hand the buffered text to a channel-supplied
//! [`RelaySink`]. [`handle_relay_event`] is what both
//! [`crate::telegram::outbound::handle_event`] and
//! [`crate::channels::discord::outbound::handle_event`] delegate to today;
//! each channel still hand-rolls its own outer `run_outbound_observer`
//! subscribe loop (`tokio::select!` over shutdown vs. the next event) around
//! that call, since Telegram's also drives per-channel-only behavior
//! (the typing heartbeat) this shared step doesn't model.
//!
//! Deliberately excludes anything a channel treats as its own: the actual
//! network send — token resolution, chunking, wire-format conversion, the
//! request itself, and any per-chunk fallback — lives behind
//! [`RelaySink::relay`]. Per-channel-only behavior like Telegram's typing
//! heartbeat (driven off `RunStarted`, which this step doesn't even look at)
//! isn't part of this shared skeleton at all — a channel that needs it keeps
//! driving its own event handling for that outside this call.
//!
//! [`recover_lagged_replies`] is the other half both channels' outer loops
//! share: what to do when the `EventBus` broadcast receiver itself reports
//! `RecvError::Lagged` instead of handing back an event. A dropped
//! `TextComplete`/`RunEnded` pair used to mean the assistant's reply simply
//! never reached the user, indistinguishable from being ignored — this
//! recovers it from the thread's persisted transcript instead of the
//! (now-incomplete) live stream.
//!
//! [`handle_relay_event`]'s `RunEnded` arm covers the sibling case: a run
//! that ends live, on the happy path, but without ever producing a
//! substantive reply. [`terminal_failure_notice`] turns the bare
//! [`RunEndReason`] tag into a short, honest, sanitized notice for every
//! reason but `Completed` — a crash, timeout, or cancellation used to leave
//! the channel just as silent as a reply the user never got, with no way to
//! tell the two apart.
