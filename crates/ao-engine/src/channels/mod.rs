//! Channel-agnostic abstraction over "a running inbound binding."
//!
//! [`ChannelTransport`] is the seam a messaging channel (Telegram, a future
//! IMAP-polled email inbox, ...) plugs into so the supervisor
//! ([`crate::telegram::ChannelBridge`]) never needs to know about any
//! channel's secrets (bot tokens, IMAP passwords, ...) or its inbound
//! transport shape (long-poll vs. gateway push vs. IMAP `UNSEEN` poll). The
//! supervisor only ever sees an opaque [`ChannelTransport::fingerprint`]
//! string for change detection and a [`ChannelTransport::spawn`] handle it
//! starts and cancels.
//!
//! [`submit_inbound_message`] is the shared delivery path every transport's
//! inbound loop calls once it has accepted a message: it writes the message
//! into the binding's dedicated bridge thread and submits it to the agent's
//! queue exactly like a typed chat turn, tagged with a channel-agnostic
//! [`MessageSource::Channel`].
