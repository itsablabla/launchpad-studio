//! The Socket Mode connect/dispatch/reconnect loop — Slack's analogue of
//! `crate::channels::discord::runner::run_discord_gateway_loop`, but a
//! materially different shape because Socket Mode's protocol is materially
//! different: no resumable session, no client-driven heartbeat, and no
//! backfill/engagement layer. A dead connection always
//! reconnects from scratch — `connections.open` mints a fresh one-shot URL
//! every time, there is nothing to resume.
//!
//! # Warm rotation (no in-repo precedent)
//!
//! Slack proactively rotates a Socket Mode connection roughly every hour —
//! and ahead of a forced close too — by sending a `disconnect` envelope
//! (`refresh_requested` or `warning`) a short while before the socket
//! actually drops. Reacting to that by closing the
//! current socket and then reconnecting leaves a gap: any envelope Slack
//! delivers between "you're about to lose me" and "the old socket is
//! actually gone" has nowhere to land. The fix carried out here is to
//! briefly hold **two** sockets rather than one:
//!
//! 1. **Steady state** is a single `active` socket, exactly like a fresh
//!    connect.
//! 2. A `disconnect` envelope on `active` does **not** close it. Instead a
//!    second socket (`incoming`) is opened via the same seam's
//!    `connections.open` call, and both sockets are read concurrently.
//! 3. Every envelope off *either* socket runs through the **same** single
//!    [`SeenEventIds`] instance. This is what makes the overlap safe, not
//!    ack timing: if Slack redelivers one event on both sockets during the
//!    handover, the second copy is simply a duplicate and is dropped by
//!    dedup like any other redelivery. The ack itself is still sent back
//!    on whichever socket actually delivered the envelope, immediately.
//! 4. The moment `incoming` delivers its own `hello`, it is promoted:
//!    it becomes the new `active`, and the previous `active` becomes the
//!    one being retired.
//! 5. The retired socket is **grace-drained** — kept open and still
//!    read+acked for a short window, in case Slack had a little more
//!    in-flight traffic queued for it — then closed.
//! 6. If `incoming` never reaches `hello` (a failed connect, or it times
//!    out), it is discarded outright rather than promoted. Nothing about
//!    `active` changes in that case; the connection simply falls back to
//!    an ordinary reconnect-from-scratch whenever `active` itself
//!    eventually hard-closes.
