///    that attachment is unreliable — the vibrancy setup in `run()`'s `.setup()`
///    hook makes the window transparent and layers an `NSVisualEffectView` into
///    its view hierarchy, which can prevent the sheet's completion handler from
///    ever firing and previously caused an unrecoverable `RecvError` panic.
///    Calling `rfd`'s synchronous `pick_folder()` directly shows a plain
///    application-modal panel with no sheet/parent-window involved, avoiding
///    that interaction entirely.
/// 2. It lets us wrap the panel construction in `catch_unwind`. macOS's
///    `NSOpenPanel::openPanel` panics (rather than returning an error) when the
///    OS-hosted `com.apple.view-bridge` panel service refuses the request —
///    e.g. when the running process's on-disk binary no longer matches what's
///    mapped in memory after a dev rebuild, or the process is flagged as
///    debugged/instrumented. Going through the dialog plugin's own async
///    `pick_folder` wrapper, that panic fires inside a closure the plugin
///    schedules onto the main thread internally, a call stack this command
///    can't reach with `catch_unwind`. Building the panel ourselves inside our
///    own `run_on_main_thread` closure keeps the whole chain in one frame we
///    control, so a refused panel becomes a `None` result instead of taking
///    down the whole app.

///
/// The relaunched process picks up the newly-active workspace by reading

/// it pins `LAUNCHPAD_STUDIO_DATA_DIR` on this process, and Tauri's restart
/// re-launches the current binary via `std::process::Command` without
/// clearing the environment — so that in-process `setenv` survives into the

/// therefore reads as a deliberate operator pin. Left in place it would
/// outrank the registry forever, silently discarding the very activation
/// this restart exists to apply. [`ao_protocol::data_root::unpin_startup_fallback_root`]
/// clears ONLY that self-inflicted pin; a pin inherited from the launching
/// environment (the dual-worktree contract's) is left untouched, so a
