          {/* Left foot. A concave Bezier "flare" that lets the tab's
            straight side border curve outward into open space at the top
            instead of butting into a hard corner — the Chrome-tab look.
            viewBox y grows downward; `top:-2px` places local y=2 exactly at
            the tab's own top edge (tab-relative y=0). The curve runs from
            the body side (8,10 — vertical tangent, continuing the left
            border) up to (0,2) — horizontal tangent, so it terminates flush
            and level rather than cutting off at an angle.

            The curve's own tangent point (x=8, tab-relative real x=0 via
            `left:-8px` below) only TOUCHES the CSS border's outer edge —
            it doesn't overlap the border's own 1px-wide paint band
            (tab-relative x∈[0,1)) at all. Two independently-rendered lines
            (an SVG stroke here, a CSS border on the tab's own box) that
            merely touch rather than overlap don't reliably fuse into one
            continuous edge: sub-pixel/antialiasing rounding differences
            between the two rendering paths can leave the straight CSS
            border partly un-masked right beside the curve, reading as a
            second, disjointed line floating apart from the flare instead
            of sitting flush on it (this bit us twice now — first as a
            stray fill notch above the tab's top edge, now as this). So the
            fill's own footprint (the `L12,2 L12,10` below) reaches 4px past
            the border — comfortably past its 1px band regardless of
            rounding — instead of stopping exactly at it; only the
            invisible mask grows, the visible stroke path is untouched.
            `left:-8px` (not -7px) keeps the curve's tangent flush with the
            border's outer edge instead of lapping 1px inside it — the old
            1px lap was itself relying on the same "just touching" masking
            this comment is moving away from. If you retune the flare keep
            these in sync: the tab-top alignment (top:-2px ↔ the `2` in the
            paths), the flare depth (the `10`), and the 8px horizontal
            offset (also referenced by the gap/safe-paint-area comments
            below, in the outer tab row). */}

            between Main and the More pill (both `shrink-0`), so it's the
            one that absorbs all the shrink pressure as the window narrows.
            Each pill inside compresses down to its own MIN_PILL_WIDTH_CLASS
            floor (see `renderTab`) via ordinary flexbox shrink + CSS
            ellipsis truncation — Chrome-tab-style, no measuring involved.
            Once even the floor doesn't leave room for everyone,
            `overflow-hidden` here clips the trailing (oldest,
            furthest-from-Main) pills rather than wrapping them to a second
            row or shoving Main/More off-screen — they're still one click
            away via the More panel, which always renders the full,
            unclipped thread list regardless of what's visible here.
            `px-[9px] -mx-[9px]` is a "safe paint area" trick, not visible
            padding: it grows the clip box 9px past each edge while the
            matching negative margin cancels that growth for the OUTER
            row's own layout (so Main/More sit exactly where they always
            did) — the 9px just gives the ACTIVE tab's flared "feet" (see
            the SVGs in `renderTab`, which flare 8px past the pill's own
            box on each side) a 1px margin to render uncropped when that
            tab is first/last in this group, instead of the new
            `overflow-hidden` hard-clipping a curve that was never clipped
            before.
            `pt-[4px] -mt-[4px]` is the same trick on the vertical axis: the
            active tab's own box reaches 1px above this row (`-mt-[1px]` in
            `renderTab`, tucking it under the header so it reads as hanging
            from the navbar) and its feet reach a further 2px above that —
            3px of upward reach in total. Without this, whenever the ACTIVE
            tab is one of these (i.e. not Main, which sits outside this
            wrapper), that whole 3px got clipped at this div's own top edge,
            silently deleting the feet's curve before it ever painted — so
            the header's bottom border ran straight across the top of the
            tab uninterrupted instead of curving around it.
            `gap-[10px]` matches the outer row's gap above for the same
            reason: it has to clear the active tab's 8px foot reach so a
            neighbouring pill's own fill doesn't get painted over — this is
            the gap BETWEEN pills inside the group, not the padding/margin
            described above (which only widens the clip box, not the pills'
            actual spacing). */}
