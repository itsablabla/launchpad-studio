/** The `kind` of the enabled channel binding whose dedicated bridge thread is

 *  Mirrors the backend's `is_channel_bridge_thread` predicate
 *  (`crates/ao-engine/src/agent_runner/native.rs`) exactly — two checks,
 *  either sufficient on its own:
 *
 *  1. The classic reverse lookup: some binding in `profile.channels` is
 *     enabled and its `bridge_thread_id` equals `threadId`. Covers every
 *     channel that provisions one thread per binding (Telegram, Discord,
 *     Email). `profile.channels` is the only field a fetched `AgentProfile`
 *     actually carries this on; the legacy `profile.telegram` field is
 *     input-only and never appears in server output.
 *  2. `threadChannelOrigin` — the thread's own `channel_origin`, which the
 *     caller reads off the already-fetched `Thread` row and passes in —
 *     names a `binding_id` that's enabled in `profile.channels`. Covers a
 *     channel that provisions one thread per *conversation* instead (Slack),
 *     where `bridge_thread_id` is never populated at all — see
 *     `ChannelBridgeOrigin`'s docstring (`types/api.ts`).
 *
 *  This is the source of truth `isChannelBridgeThread` below derives from —
 *  callers that need to *name* the matched channel (e.g. ChatView's
 *  read-only hint, which used to hardcode "Telegram" regardless of which
 *  channel actually bridged the thread) should call this directly instead of
 *  re-deriving the match themselves. */
